## Progression:

* 11/5/2020- Wireframe and project board were completed and turned in as Day 1 deliverables.  Initial files were created and respective Classes instantiated for Game and Player. First draft of HTML and CSS were completed.

* 11/6/2020- Main.js was started with initial game functionality, utilizing classes of Game and Player before connecting to the DOM.  Challenges: Deciding how to format winning conditions and board spaces in the Game class.  I challenged myself to go as far as possible into functionality without incorporating the DOM but because of how I assigned the spaces on the board, it's hard to visualize without seeing the board in action.

* 11/7/2020- Connected elements of functionality to the DOM with query selectors and event listeners.  Challenges: I had to refactor my functions quite a bit to make connectivity work, which was tricky.  I hoped to iterate through an array of possible winning combinations but I wasn't able to log the results correctly, so I opted for a long else if statement that I'm planning to refactor later.  Wins: The checkForWin function works and is successfully connected to the DOM.
