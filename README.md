## Progression:

* 11/5/2020- Wireframe and project board were completed and turned in as Day 1 deliverables.  Initial files were created and respective Classes instantiated for Game and Player. First draft of HTML and CSS were completed.

* 11/6/2020- Main.js was started with initial game functionality, utilizing classes of Game and Player before connecting to the DOM.  Challenges: Deciding how to format winning conditions and board spaces in the Game class.  I challenged myself to go as far as possible into functionality without incorporating the DOM but because of how I assigned the spaces on the board, it's hard to visualize without seeing the board in action.
